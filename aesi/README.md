# Adaptable Editor Services Interface
This project contains the interfaces and basic data structures for AESI,
the Adaptable Editor Services Interface.  This is a collection of
generic interfaces that, when implemented by a language, supports the
language in any editor for which an AESI adapter is available.

This project also contains utility classes and functions that support
adapters and implementations of AESI.

Extensions to the basic AESI interfaces are in the `aesix` projects.
